## Vision Statement

> For busy professionals managing 30+ tasks across multiple projects who feel constantly overwhelmed who struggle to identify what truly matters each day among competing priorities and growing task lists, the product is a an intelligent task management application that surfaces the right tasks at the right time based on deadlines, dependencies, and personal work patterns. Unlike traditional static todo lists like Todoist, Apple Reminders, or paper-based systems, our product dynamically prioritizes tasks using contextual intelligence rather than requiring manual organization and constant re-sorting.

- **Specific:** Acquire 500 paying users who each complete at least 50 tasks using SuperTasker's dynamic prioritization feature
- **Measurable:** Track monthly active users, conversion to paid plans, and task completion rate through the intelligent prioritization system vs manual task selection
- **Achievable:** Requires building MVP with core prioritization engine, launching beta program targeting 3-5 professional communities, and dedicating 2 engineers plus 1 product marketer for 6 months
- **Relevant:** Validates that busy professionals will pay for intelligent task prioritization and proves the differentiation from static todo lists resonates with the target market

#### Prove Prioritization Algorithm Effectiveness
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Timeline:** Complete data collection and analysis by March 31, 2026 (4 months from now)
- **Specific:** Demonstrate that SuperTasker users complete 40% more high-priority tasks on time compared to their previous task management method
- **Measurable:** Conduct baseline survey of user's prior completion rates, then track daily task completion metrics and user-reported outcomes after 30 days of active use
- **Achievable:** Requires implementing analytics dashboard, designing pre/post user surveys, and collecting data from minimum 200 active users with established task patterns over 60-day period
- **Relevant:** Directly validates the core differentiation—that contextual intelligence actually helps users accomplish what matters most, not just organize tasks differently
